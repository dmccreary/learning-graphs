# Dependency Analysis

In this chapter we will look at algorithms that help find all the
dependencies of a given concept within a course learning graph.

This is not just finding all the direct dependencies of a concept.
It is also about finding the dependencies of the dependencies etc.
The number of levels we search is called the number of "hops"
in the dependency graph.
