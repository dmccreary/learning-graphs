# About the Learning Graphs Website

The goal of this website is to enable teaching the concepts around Learning Graphs.  It was inspired by the cyberpunk science fiction novel [Diamond Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age) by Neal Stephenson.  In this novel, a child uses a tablet-like device that customizes stories to the needs of the child.  This form of highly-customized learning is our goal.  We believe that learning graphs are the core data structure that these intelligent learning agents will be built on.

Learning Graphs are [concept dependency graphs](glossary.md/#concept-dependency-graph) that are used to:

1. Understand the important [concepts](glossary.md#concept) in a course and their dependencies
2. Suggest [learning paths](glossary.md#learning-path) to achieve [learning objectives](glossary.md#learning-objective)
3. Serve as the core data structure for [hyper-personalization](glossary.md#hyper-personalization) of lesson plans by [generative AI](glossary.md#generative-ai) and other content such as [MicroSims](glossary.md#microsim) by [agents](glossary.md#agent).

## Course Learning Objectives

<!--
Please suggest 10 learning objectives for a course on learning graphs (concept dependency graphs or CDGs) using the Bloom Taxonomy.  These graphs are used to

1. Understand the important concepts in a course and their dependencies
2. Suggest learning paths to achieve learning objectives
3. Serve as the core data structure for hyper-personalization of lesson plans by generative AI agents when integrated with a Learning Management System

Make sure to cover how to use GenAI to find the concepts in a course, use GenAI to find concept dependencies, generate course concept taxonomies, view the graphs using tools like vis.js, edit the graphs, use the graphs to generate personalized lesson plans and build intelligent agents to use the CDGs to build hyper-customized lesson plans for each student.

Here are 10 learning objectives for a course on learning **Concept Dependency Graphs (CDGs)** using Bloom's Taxonomy, aligned with the use of Generative AI (GenAI) for analyzing course content, creating concept taxonomies, visualizing, editing, and personalizing lesson plans:

### 1. **Remembering**:

**Identify the basic structure of Concept Dependency Graphs (CDGs)** used to model concepts and their dependencies in a course.

*Example: Define the nodes and edges in a CDG and recognize them in different graphical representations.*

### 2. **Understanding**:

**Explain how CDGs represent the relationships between course concepts** and how they suggest learning paths based on these dependencies.

*Example: Describe how prerequisite concepts are connected to higher-level concepts within a CDG.*

### 3. **Applying**:

**Use Generative AI to generate concepts lists or use NLP frameworks to extract key concepts from course materials** and generate a list of vertices (nodes) for building a CDG.

*Example: Apply AI tools to analyze a syllabus or textbook and identify core concepts.*

### 4. Apply JavaScript Graph Libraries

Use [vis.js](glossary.md#visjs) (or similar tools) to visualize a Concept Dependency Graph** for a given set of concepts and dependencies.

-   *Example: Use vis.js to create an interactive graph of course concepts and their dependencies.*

### 5. Analyzing Dependencies

Analyze concept relationships using Generative AI to discover hidden dependencies that may not be immediately obvious from the course materials.

**Example:** Use an AI agent to uncover both direct and indirect concept dependencies based on patterns found in text data.

### 6. Evaluating

**Evaluate the quality of a generated CDG** in terms of completeness, accuracy, and alignment with learning objectives.

**Example:** Critically assess a CDG created by AI for coverage of all key topics and concept dependencies.

### 7.  Assess
Analyze personalized learning paths generated from a CDG**, ensuring they meet the individual learning objectives of diverse student profiles.

**Example:** Review AI-generated personalized lesson plans for different student backgrounds and adjust if needed.*

### 8. Creating

**Use Generative AI to automatically generate concept lists, dependencies, and concept taxonomies** for a course, organizing concepts into hierarchical categories that represent broader topics.

**Example:** Create a hierarchical taxonomy of concepts in a data structures course using GenAI tools.

### 9.  Edit CGSs
Edit a CDG interactively to improve learning pathways**, adding or removing dependencies between concepts based on AI suggestions or instructor insights.

**Example:** Modify a CDG for a calculus course by adding missing concepts or removing unnecessary dependencies.

### 10.  **Design intelligent AI agents that use CDGs to generate hyper-personalized lesson plans**, adapting to each student's learning progress and needs.

**Example:** Build an AI system that integrates with a Learning Management System (LMS) to continuously update personalized learning paths based on the student's mastery of concepts.

### Summary

Each of these objectives integrates various levels of Bloom's Taxonomy (from remembering and understanding basic concepts to applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating new knowledge) while leveraging Generative AI and CDGs to enhance the learning process.
