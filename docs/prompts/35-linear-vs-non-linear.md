# Linear vs Non-Linear Learning

!!! prompt
Run the microsim-vis-network skill on the following requirements.
Create a new microsim using the vis-network JS library.
Use ellipses for nodes.
Label the edges DEPENDS_ON in a 8 point font.
You will have a list of 40 connected topics from a calculus course.  See @docs/sims/linear-vs-non-linear.json
They will be presented in two ways.
1. Sequential Order - where one concept leads only to the next topic and they 
concepts flow in a serpentine pattern from to to bottom
2. Learning Graph - where the graph starts out with concept 1 (Limits) pinned on the left but a force directed graph arranges the concept in concept dependency order

The title is "Learning is Nonlinear"
The controls have two radio buttons in a bottom control area for "Linear Learning" and "Nonlinear Learning"
