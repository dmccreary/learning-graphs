Very Good.  Lets call the number associated with each category the TaxonomyID.
Next, for each line in the CSV file, add another column that has the primary TaxonomyID of the Concept.
Return a new CSV file with with 150 rows.

The CSV file will have the following format:

1. Column 1: ConceptID
2. Column 2: ConceptLabel
3. Column 3: Dependencies
4. Column 4: TaxonomyID
