# Graph Editor

!!! prompt
    Please create a vis.js application that will allow me to read in a JSON 
    file of nodes and edges and then allow me to edit the graph by adding, 
    updating and removing nodes and edges and their properties.  
    Have a menu in the top left to load a JSON file and a menu to save the JSON file.  
    Use the vis.js default node editing tools.  Use a property editor to allow
    each node to have the following properties:

    1. label
    2. group
    3. shape
    4. backgroundColor
    5. url
    6. description

    1. label
