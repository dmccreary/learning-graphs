# Course Description Prompts

## Sample Prompt to Generate a Course Description

```linenums="0"
Design a detailed and engaging course description for a
college-level course titled [SUBJECT]
that is suitable for undergraduate students in
[DEPARTMENT1] or {DEPARTMENT2}.

Leverage Bloom’s Taxonomy to structure the course, detailing
the knowledge, skills, and applications students will
develop at each cognitive level (remember, understand,
apply, analyze, evaluate, and create).

In the description, highlight how generative AI will
serve as a primary teaching tool in the following ways:

Metaphors and Analogies: Explain how generative AI will
dynamically create metaphors that help students understand
complex circuits and system concepts intuitively, for example,
comparing [XXX] to [YYY] different contexts.

Stories and Lessons: Illustrate how AI-generated narratives will guide students through historical milestones in circuit design, with characters like pioneering engineers or scientists to add context and enhance engagement.

Content Generation: Describe how AI will develop interactive content—such as real-time quizzes, customized practice problems, and detailed walkthroughs of circuit diagrams—that align with students' progress and areas of improvement.

Simulations and Animations: Outline how AI-powered simulations will allow students to interact with virtual circuit models, adjusting parameters and observing outcomes in real-time, and how animations will visually represent phenomena like current flow and voltage changes.

Learning Activities and Projects: Explain how generative AI will generate scaffolded project suggestions based on Bloom’s higher-order objectives, like creating their own circuit designs or troubleshooting complex systems. AI should provide formative feedback throughout each step to foster critical thinking.

Assessment and Feedback: Describe how AI-driven assessments will go beyond traditional grading, providing personalized feedback loops that prompt self-reflection, track learning progress, and guide students through iterative problem-solving exercises.

The course description should aim to inspire curiosity and convey how AI enhances interactivity and personalizes the learning journey, supporting students in achieving a deep and practical understanding of circuits and systems.
