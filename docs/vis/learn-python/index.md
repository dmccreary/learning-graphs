# Learn Python and Data Science

## Prompt

Create a graph in vis.js format for learning data science with Python. Make Learn Python the first Concept, but then make that a prerequsite to many Python data science packages like NumPi, SciKitLearn, PyTourch etc.

Here is an example of a **vis.js** graph configuration representing a learning graph for data science with Python. The first concept is "Learn Python," which is a prerequisite for various Python data science packages like NumPy, SciKitLearn, and PyTorch.

```

Copy code

`var nodes = new vis.DataSet([
  { id: 1, label: "Learn Python", title: "Basic Python Programming" },
  { id: 2, label: "Learn NumPy", title: "Numerical computing with Python" },
  { id: 3, label: "Learn Pandas", title: "Data manipulation and analysis" },
  { id: 4, label: "Learn Matplotlib", title: "Data visualization with Python" },
  { id: 5, label: "Learn SciKitLearn", title: "Machine learning with Python" },
  { id: 6, label: "Learn TensorFlow", title: "Deep learning with Python" },
  { id: 7, label: "Learn PyTorch", title: "Deep learning with Python" },
  { id: 8, label: "Learn Seaborn", title: "Statistical data visualization" },
  { id: 9, label: "Learn Statsmodels", title: "Statistical models in Python" },
]);

var edges = new vis.DataSet([
  { from: 1, to: 2, label: "prerequisite" },
  { from: 1, to: 3, label: "prerequisite" },
  { from: 1, to: 4, label: "prerequisite" },
  { from: 1, to: 5, label: "prerequisite" },
  { from: 1, to: 6, label: "prerequisite" },
  { from: 1, to: 7, label: "prerequisite" },
  { from: 1, to: 8, label: "prerequisite" },
  { from: 1, to: 9, label: "prerequisite" },
]);

var container = document.getElementById("mynetwork");
var data = {
  nodes: nodes,
  edges: edges,
};
var options = {
  nodes: {
    shape: "box",
    size: 20,
    color: {
      background: "#ffffff",
      border: "#000000",
    },
    font: {
      color: "#000000",
      size: 14,
    },
  },
  edges: {
    arrows: "to",
    smooth: true,
  },
  layout: {
    hierarchical: {
      direction: "LR", // Left to right layout
      sortMethod: "directed",
    },
  },
};
var network = new vis.Network(container, data, options);
`

```

### Explanation:

-   **Nodes**: Each concept (e.g., "Learn Python," "Learn NumPy") is represented as a node.
-   **Edges**: Each edge represents a prerequisite relationship. The `from` attribute specifies the starting node (e.g., "Learn Python") and the `to` attribute specifies the dependent concept (e.g., "Learn NumPy").
-   **Layout**: The layout is hierarchical and flows from left to right (LR), with arrows pointing from the prerequisite concept to the dependent concept.

### Concepts Flow:

1.  **Learn Python** is the foundation, required for all other data science packages.
2.  **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **SciKitLearn**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Seaborn**, and **Statsmodels** are all dependent on a solid understanding of Python.
