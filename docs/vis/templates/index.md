# Vis.js Templates for Learning Graph

The following are a list of template files you
can use to create your own learning graphs that
embody the best practices we have learned.

We begin with the simplest template and
proceed to more complex versions.  If you
are using generative AI tools, providing them
with the simplest template for a working
learning graph is a good first step.

## Single Template HTML File

This is a very simple of a learning graph example
for arithmetic that uses our best practices.

[Single HTML File Template](./single-html-file.html)

Specifically you will see that:

1. All nodes are associated with a group.
2. All edges have an arrow on the "to" end.
3. Foundation elements use a red box
4. Goals use a gold star shape.
5. The physics engine place all nodes on the graph.
6. You can drag the central nodes around with both X and Y,
but the foundation and goal nodes have a fixed horizontal position

This example is ideal when you have a small example where you want
to edit the HTML file directly and the CSS and JavaScript are imbedded
directly in the HTML.
