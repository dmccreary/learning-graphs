A legend is a key that shows you what different shapes, icons, images and colors imply
in your learning graphs.
There are several ways to place a legend on your learning graph
and each method has tradeoffs.

## HTML Table Legend

HTML tables usually are located in a fixed position of the edge of a graph viewer.
They have the benefit of having a regular structure that is easy to align.
They can also be configured to appear and disappear if the screen region
is needed for viewing the full graph.
