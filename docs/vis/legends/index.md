# Learning Graph Legends

A legend is a key that shows you what different shapes, icons, images and colors imply
in your learning graphs.  We will demo two ways to place a legend on your learning graph
and each method has tradeoffs.

[Node Legend](node-legend.html) - which uses nodes in the upper left area to
show the legend.  This legend tends to move around based on the scale of the
graph layout.

[HTML Table Legend](html-legend.html) - which uses a HTML table in a
CSS flexbox to display the legend.  The HTML table is usually placed
in a border region such as a left-sidebar.  This allows you to collapse
the sidebar with a toggle button (hamburger icon).

## Node Legend

The node legend has the advantage that it can use exactly the same colors, shapes, icons
and images as the nodes in the actual graph.

Here is a good example of how this might look:

Unfortunately, this legend can easily overlap with the actual graph network.

Here is a bad example where the actual nodes overlap the legend.

Sample of how node legends are use is at [node-legend.js](./html-legend.html) which
was originally taken from the [vis.js node legend example](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/examples/network/exampleApplications/nodeLegend.html).

## HTML Table Legend

HTML tables usually are located in a fixed position of the edge of a graph viewer.
In the example above, we use a left-sidebar.
They have the benefit of having a regular structure that is easy to align.
They can also be configured to appear and disappear if the screen region
is needed for viewing the full graph.

## Felxbox Layout

The flexbox layout strategy allows us to just put in an HTML table with
an max value.  All the other region dimensions are calculated automatically with CSS.

### Explanation:

-   `display: flex` on the `body` element allows `#sidebar` and `#main` to sit side by side.
-   `#sidebar` automatically resizes based on its content, constrained by `max-width`.
-   `#main` with `flex: 1` takes up the remaining available space.

This approach avoids conflicts and should handle dynamic sizing for the sidebar smoothly.
Hereâ€™s an and example of the CSS using flexbox for layout control:

```html
<body>
    <div id="sidebar">
        <h3>Legend Sidebar</h3>
        <button id="toggle-button" onclick="toggleSidebar()">&#9776;</button>
        <table>
          <!--  table data here -->
        </table>
    </div>
    <div id="main">
        <div id="mynetwork"></div>
    </div>
</body>
```

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    display: flex;
}

#sidebar {
    width: auto; /* Automatically adjust width based on content in the table */
    max-width: 300px; /* Set a maximum width to avoid excessive size */
    padding: 5px; /* around the sidebar */
    margin-right: 10px; /* Space between sidebar and main content */
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

#main {
    flex: 1; /* Takes up remaining space to the right */
    padding: 10px;
}

#mynetwork {
    width: 100%;
    height: 700px;
    background-color: aliceblue;
    border: 1px solid lightgray;
}
```
