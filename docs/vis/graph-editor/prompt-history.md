## Adding Details to Node

```
What are the most common properties that a user sets on a node? I can think of the following: 
1. Label 
2. Title (for hover text) 
3. Shape (selected from a list of shapes) 
4. Size 
5. Background color (select from list) 
6. Edge color (select from list) 
7. x 
8. y 
9. Fixed location (checkbox) 

What other parameters might a person change? Update the JavaScript to allow all these parameters to be visible when creating a new node or updating a node.

In addition to the properties you've already listed, here are some other common node properties that users might want to set:

1.  **Image** (for image-based nodes, with a URL to an image)
2.  **Font** (size, color, face for the label)
3.  **Border Width** (controls the thickness of the node's border)
4.  **Border Color** (set separately from edge color, allows customization of node outline)
5.  **Opacity** (allows transparency on nodes)
6.  **Shadow** (option to add shadows for depth perception)
7.  **Group** (used to assign nodes into categories for different styles or behaviors)
8.  **Icon** (if using icons instead of labels)
9.  **Physics** (whether the node is affected by physics simulation)

### Updated JavaScript for Node Creation/Editing Form

Here is an updated version of your **graph-editor.js** that includes a form for setting all these parameters when creating or editing nodes:
