# Beginning Electronics

This is the beginning of a new textbook on beginning electronics
we are building for junior-high school students.  It is based
on using a solderless breadboard and about $30 worth of various
electrical components.  We do not cover digital electronics
in depth and we assume that no oscilloscopes are available.
We try to have MicroSims that also simulate the behavior of the
parts on a breadboard.
