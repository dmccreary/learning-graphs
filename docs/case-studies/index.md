# Case Studies

Here are some case studies of Learning Graphs I have worked on with others.
The list is alphabetical and you will find that the maturity of
the on-line material varies widely based on the needs and resources of
each group I work with.  What they all share in common is that
they have a course description that was used to drive a generative
process to build a learning graph.

In general when we create a website using a
tool like mkdocs, we structure all the content under the ```docs```
directory.  Within docs we place our interactive simulations (MicroSim)
under the ```sims``` directory by convention.  I would suggest
creating a sim called ```graph-viewer``` inside the sims directory.

Many of the websites I setup also walk people through the process of
learning to write GenAI prompts to generate the first draft of
a learning graph.  If that is the case, the output of these
prompts is located in the ```docs/prompts/learning-graph`` area.

## Circuits

This was the course that I worked on with [Sharat Batra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharatbatra/)
at the University of Minnesota.  He has been an inspiration for me, helping me
understand the time-consuming nature of generating circuit diagrams, equations and
assessments in his daily teaching work.

## Geometry

This is a classic high school geometry course that lends itself to visual thinking.

## Graph Algorithms

This website is based on the graph algorithms course I developed for my hands-on graph courses in my consultant practice.  I was fortunate to develop graph database related courses that over 3,000 people have taken in the past.
The core courses were actually an introduction to graph databases which was an online self-paced course
and an instructor-led Hands On Graph course that used TigerGraph.  I hope to work
with volunteers to get those courses in the public domain sometime in the future.

## Learning Graph

This is a learning graph for creating learning graphs.  Yes, it is a bit of a recursive definition, but
this learning graph has helped me fill in the gaps of this website and put more focus
when a concept needs to be explain clearly for others to participate in the process
of building intelligent online textbooks.

## MicroPython

This is based on the course that I developed with the help of [Jim Tannenbaum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jetannenbaum/).  Jim has also used these courses in his volunteer work in schools.

One note about this course, the goal of the course are to teach computational thinking in junior high and high school students.  But we have found that the best way to teach these skills is through project-based learning
where students create what they are most curious about.  So having a rich curriculum full of projects
that drive colorful moving lights and drive robots is our best way to get these concepts into the classroom.

## MicroSims

This course was inspired by the wonderful [Val Lockhart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valockhart/).
MicroSims are small interactive simulations that are created and modified by generative AI systems
for use in classroom instruction.

## Signal Processing

This course came about in collaboration with [Jarvis Haupt](https://cse.umn.edu/ece/jarvis-haupt) at the University of Minnesota Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  Jarvis has been instrumental at encouraging others at the University of Minnesota to take a leadership role in the integration of generative AI into their courses.

## Systems Thinking

This is one of my favorite courses.  It was originally inspired by my friend [Arun Batchu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunbatchu/).  I have taught this course to a wide variety of audiences including variations for teams
trying to break down silos within organizations.
