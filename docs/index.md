Welcome to the website for Learning Graphs.  Learning
Graphs are [concept dependency graphs](glossary.md/#concept-dependency-graph) that are used to:

1. Understand the important [concepts](glossary.md#concept) in a course and their dependencies
2. Suggest [learning paths](glossary.md#learning-path) to achieve [learning objectives](glossary.md#learning-objective)
3. Serve as the core data structure for [hyper-personalization](glossary#hyper-personalization) of lesson plans by [generative AI](glossary.md#generative-ai) [agents](glossary.md#agent).

Please see the [About This Site](./about.md) for more details.
