# Course Description

Title: Customizing Learning Materials with Intelligent Agents

In this course, we will learn how on-line content can
be generated or quickly customized to the needs of
individuals or small groups of students.  We begin
with a discussion of learning concepts and the use
of concept dependency graphs (CDGs) to model these
concepts.  We then show how generative AI tools
can be used to generate these concepts or review
existing concepts graphs for suitability of
learning objectives.  We then describe the process
of creating taxonomies and ontologies that can be used
with CDGs.  We cover topics of abstraction, clustering
and graph algorithms such as graph traversal, search and dependency analysis.  Next we cover the topic of tools
to visualize and navigate CDG and explore tools
such as vis.js for visualizing CDGs.  Finally, we show how these
data structures and algorithms are used together with
intelligent agents to customize complex lesson plans for students.

Prerequisites: 

Student should have access to the internet and
be familiar with using a web browser and search
engines.  Students should also have access to a
generative AI tool such as ChatGPG.

It is helpful but not required for students should have a background
in data structures, teaching theory, lesson plans, curriculum development processes.
