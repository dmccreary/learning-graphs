A taxonomy of concept types helps create a varied learning experience.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interweaving Theory and Practice: Using a taxonomy to intermix abstract concepts with case studies, metaphors, or hands-on activities can reinforce learning.

As learners master foundational concepts, the system can automatically guide them to more advanced topics, ensuring that they progress along a logical path.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reducing Misunderstandings: By including \"common misunderstandings\" and \"warnings\" in a taxonomy, educators can proactively address areas where learners typically struggle, minimizing confusion.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"chapters/04-concept-taxonomies/#concept-taxonomy-legends","title":"Concept Taxonomy Legends","text":""},{"location":"chapters/04-concept-taxonomies/#using-a-groupsjson-file","title":"Using a groups.json File","text":"<p>In our labs, we will often generate a small taxonomy of around 10 classifiers.

First do  quality checks to make sure there is enough good content in a course  description to generate 200 high-quality concepts.  </p> <p>Give the user feedback on this process and if you have enough content then ask the user if you should proceed. The next step is to generate the preferred labels for the  200 concepts in the course. The labels should be in title case and the  length of the concept label should be under 32 characters. List the enumerated concepts in the /data/course-concepts-v1.md as a  numbered list. Tell the user you have created the file and ask them to review the  concepts.  Tell the user you can add or remove concepts from this list.</p> <p>The next step is to generate a dependency list for these concepts.  The  format of this list is a CSV file with columns for ConceptID (an integer),  the ConceptLabel, and Dependencies.  Dependancies is pipe delimited list of  the ConceptIDs that this concept depends on.  Save the file into a CSV file  at /data/concept-dependencies.csv.   Then do some quality checks.  Make sure that every concept except the  foundational prerequsites have at least one dependancies.   Foundational prerequsite concepts and no dependencies.  Concept should  never depend on themselves. The graph should not have cycles.  Learning graphs are directed acyclic  graphs. After you have a dependency graph check for orphaned nodes and disconneted  subgraphs.  Create a report on the key quality metrics. A graph where every  concept dendon only the prior concept is not a high quality learning graph. Note that some concepts have a high indegree (the number of other concepts  that depend in that concept.  Generate a report for the user of the 10 nodes  that have the highest indegree.</p> <p>The next step is to create a 12 category taxonomy for all the concepts.  Try  to pick categories that evenly divide the concepts.  You can use a few more  or less categories if you find natural groupings.  Place the taxonomy in  /data/concept-taxonomy.md  Now add one more column to the CSV file called  TaxonomyID.  Try to use 3-5 letter abbreviation for the taxonomy ID. For  each concept, add the best match to a TaxonomyID.  If there are no close  matches use the TaxonomyID \"MISC\".</p> <p>The create a report for the user showing distribution of the count of  concepts in each category.  Suggest other categories if one category has too  many concepts (over 30% of the total).  Place the report in  /data/taxonomy-distribution.md as a markdown table.  Tell the usr you are  done!

The edges in the Concept plane are learning dependencies.  You can't learn some advanced concepts until you learn about the concepts that they depend on.  This plane is represented by the green network graph in the figure above.</p> <p>The second plane is a Content Plane.  This plane stores a list verticies that reference all the content related to one or  more Concepts.  Content is often linked to other content through links such as hyptertext links between web pages. This plane is the blue plane below the green plane in the figure above.</p> <p>Connecting these two planes are Concept to Content links, drawn in purple links in the figure above. Note that these are not just one-to-one relationships.  A web page might refernced many Concepts and a Concept could be explained and used in many pages.</p> <p>What is important to understand is that concepts and content work together to create recommendations for learning paths for students.  For example, imagine that a student wants to master a complex concept. But first they must learn three other Concepts.  Each of these has an order, and the content that they are connected to would be recommended by a Chatbot or a Learning Agent.</p>"},{"location":"sims/graph-viewer/","title":"Learning Graph Viewer","text":"<p>Run the Learning Graph Viewer</p> <p>This viewer reads a learning graph data from ../../learning-graph/learning-graph.json:</p> <ol> <li>Search Functionality - Quick node lookup with autocomplete</li> <li>Taxonomy Legend Controls - Filter nodes by category/taxonomy</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sims/graph-viewer/#features","title":"Features","text":""},{"location":"sims/graph-viewer/#search","title":"Search","text":"<ul> <li>Type-ahead search for node names</li> <li>Displays matching results in a dropdown</li> <li>Shows node group/category in results</li> <li>Clicking a result focuses and highlights the node on the graph</li> <li>Only searches visible nodes (respects taxonomy filters)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sims/graph-viewer/#taxonomy-legend-with-checkboxes","title":"Taxonomy Legend with Checkboxes","text":"<ul> <li>Sidebar legend with all node categories</li> <li>Toggle visibility of entire node groups</li> <li>Color-coded categories matching the graph</li> <li>\"Check All\" and \"Uncheck All\" buttons for bulk operations</li> <li>Collapsible sidebar to maximize graph viewing area</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sims/graph-viewer/#graph-statistics","title":"Graph Statistics","text":"<p>Real-time statistics that update as you filter: - Nodes: Count of visible nodes - Edges: Count of visible edges (both endpoints must be visible) - Orphans: Nodes with no connections (this is an indication that the learning graph needs editing)</p>"},{"location":"sims/graph-viewer/#sample-graph-demo","title":"Sample Graph Demo","text":"<p>The demo includes a Graph Theory learning graph with 10 taxonomy categories:</p> <ul> <li>Foundation (Red) - Core concepts in red boxes that should be pinned to the left</li> <li>Types (Orange) - Graph types</li> <li>Representations (Gold) - Data structures</li> <li>Algorithms (Green) - Basic algorithms</li> <li>Paths (Blue) - Shortest path algorithms</li> <li>Flow (Indigo) - Network flow algorithms</li> <li>Advanced (Violet) - Advanced topics</li> <li>Metrics (Gray) - Centrality measures</li> <li>Spectral (Brown) - Spectral theory</li> <li>ML &amp; Networks (Teal) - Machine learning</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sims/graph-viewer/#usage-tips","title":"Usage Tips","text":"<ol> <li>Hide a category - Uncheck a category in the sidebar to hide all nodes in that group</li> <li>Search within visible nodes - Use search to quickly find specific concepts among visible nodes</li> <li>Focus on a topic - Uncheck all categories, then check only the ones you want to study</li> <li>Collapse sidebar - Click the menu button (\u2630) to hide the sidebar and expand the graph view</li> <li>Find orphans - Check the statistics to see if any nodes lack connections</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sims/graph-viewer/#implementation-notes","title":"Implementation Notes","text":"<p>This viewer follows the standard vis.js architectural patterns:</p> <ul> <li>Uses <code>vis.DataSet</code> for nodes and edges</li> <li>Implements node <code>hidden</code> property for filtering</li> <li>Combines separate search and legend features</li> <li>Updates statistics dynamically based on visibility</li> <li>Maintains consistent styling across features</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sims/graph-viewer/#use-cases","title":"Use Cases","text":"<ul> <li>Course planning - Filter by topic area to design lesson sequences</li> <li>Concept exploration - Search for specific concepts and see their dependencies</li> <li>Gap analysis - Use orphan count to identify disconnected concepts</li> <li>Progressive learning - Start with foundation concepts, gradually enable advanced topics</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sims/learning-graph/","title":"Graph Viewer","text":"<p>Graph Viewer</p>"},{"location":"sims/template/","title":"MicroSim Folder index.md Template","text":"<p>Run the MicroSim Template Edit this MicroSim</p>"},{"location":"sims/template/#about-this-microsim","title":"About this MicroSim","text":"<p>This MicroSim teaches us how to calculate the time before a college loan is repaid.</p> <p>Note that the average interest rate for an undergraduate loan is 6.5% EducationData.org report</p>"},{"location":"sims/template/#sample-prompt","title":"Sample Prompt","text":"<p>Prompt</p> <p>Create a single file p5.js sketch.

I also modified the layering so that the search dropdown list appears over the graph network so the network is not pushed down the screen.</p> <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://unpkg.com/vis-network/standalone/umd/vis-network.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n       &lt;style type=\"text/css\"&gt;\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\n        }\n        #mynetwork {\n            width: 80%;\n            height: 600px;\n            background-color: aliceblue;\n            border: 1px solid silver;\n            margin: 0 auto;
